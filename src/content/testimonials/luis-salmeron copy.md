I am delighted to recommend Anastasiya Pavlyk, a highly talented and user-focused designer. During my time working with her at SpiderRock Advisors – BlackRock, I was consistently impressed by her dedication to creating exceptional user experiences.

Beyond her impressive design skills, Anastasiya is a joy to work with. Her easy-going personality and positive attitude make her a valuable asset to any team. And let's not forget her discerning taste in pastries – always a delightful conversation starter!

Anastasiya possesses a strong understanding of user-centered design principles, translating user needs into intuitive and engaging interfaces. Her skills in wireframing, prototyping, and visual design are exceptional, resulting in high-quality and visually appealing products.

She’s a highly effective communicator and collaborator, seamlessly working with cross-functional teams to bring designs to life. Her attention to detail and commitment to excellence ensure that every project meets the highest standards.

I highly recommend Anastasiya for any design role. She’s a valuable asset to any team and I am confident she will excel in her future endeavors.
